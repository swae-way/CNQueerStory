The ban was part of Weibo’s three-month "clean-up" campaign targeting pornography，violence，and homosexual posts. The move sparked outrage among Sina Weibo’s nearly 400 million users，with many protesting under the hashtag #IAmGay which was used over 500000 times and viewed more than 530 million times.

In 2017，the General Provisions of the Civil Law expanded the scope of use of this system: all adults with full capacity for civil conduct can negotiate to determine their own guardian in the form of a written agreement，and in the era of their own incapacity for guardianship and care for themselves. More and more LGBTQ+ couples are opting for voluntary guardianship，and in a country that doesn't recognize same-sex marriage，becoming one another's guardian means a legal relationship between two people who are responsible for each other.,//, 意定监护

2002-2015,性倾向就业歧视案First Case of Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation in Workplace,"法律与案件Law and Lawsuit,2014",这个案件涉及深圳一起关于性取向歧视的争议。2014年10月29日，两名男同志在街头因100元打的费用发生口角，引起围观。警察到场处理，整个过程被拍下并上传至网络，引发热议。2014年11月8日，阿易收到所在的深圳某设计公司通知，以其不遵守公司佩戴工牌和工服的纪律，并被投诉服务态度不佳为由将其解雇。阿易认为，实际原因是公司在2014年11月初获知他的同性恋身份后将其辞退。阿易起诉公司侵犯了他的平等就业权，请求法院判令公司赔礼道歉并支付5万元精神损害赔偿。南山区法院一审驳回了阿易的诉讼请求，因为证据并未明确指出解除劳动合同的原因是阿易的同性恋身份，而证据表明原因是网络视频影响公司形象。阿易随后向深圳中院提出上诉。2015年6月12日二审开庭后认为录音不足以证明解雇与同性恋身份有关，无法证明侵犯人格尊严和平等就业权。此外，阿易的离职申请表上仅写"个人处事"，与同性恋无关。法院还指出，视频走红不仅因为当事人是同性恋，更因为他们处理情感需求的方式和人生态度，引发大量负面评论。最终，二审驳回上诉，维持原判。This case involves a controversy over sexual orientation discrimination in Shenzhen.On October 29, 2014, two gay men had a verbal altercation on the street over the cost of a 100 RMB taxi, causing a crowd of onlookers. Police arrived to deal with the incident, and the whole process was filmed and uploaded to the internet, triggering a heated debate.On November 8, 2014, Ah Yi received a notice from a design company in Shenzhen, where he worked, that it had dismissed him for failing to comply with the company's discipline of wearing work permits and uniforms, and for having been complained about his poor service attitude. Yi argued that the actual reason was that the company dismissed him in early November 2014 after being informed of his homosexuality. Ah Yi sued the company for violating his right to equal employment and requested the court to order the company to apologize and pay 50000 RMB in moral damages. The Nanshan District Court rejected Yi's claim in the first instance，as the evidence did not clearly indicate that the reason for terminating the employment contract was Yi's homosexuality，and the evidence indicated that the reason was that the online video affected the company's image. Yi then appealed to the Shenzhen Intermediate Court.The second instance hearing on June 12 2015 held that the recordings were insufficient to prove that the dismissal was related to homosexuality and could not prove a violation of human dignity and the right to equal employment. In addition，Yi's application form for dismissal stated only personal matters，which had nothing to do with homosexuality. The Court also noted that the video became popular not only because the people involved were homosexuals，but also because of the way they dealt with their emotional needs and their attitude towards life，which triggered a lot of negative comments. In the end，the second trial rejected the appeal and upheld the original judgment.,https://joancliu.github.io/queerc/xiaohongmao.html, 性倾向就业歧视案

The latest progress of the developing love affair is also added to the investigation record，so as to sort out and summarize the common and different points of individual life history，so as to reflect the social life conditions of the gay group as well as their psychology，thoughts，attitudes and concepts. The book reveals that homosexuality is a universal behavior pattern in human society. By focusing on the interpretation and analysis of the living conditions of Chinese homosexuals，the author argues that their choice should be respected. The book proves that Chinese scholars' understanding of the phenomenon of homosexual sex can not only jump out of the mire of the traditional debate about whether homosexual sex is pathological，but also begin to look at homosexual sex with their own eyes and perspectives，and constantly correct their self-understanding.,//, 同性恋亚文化出版
